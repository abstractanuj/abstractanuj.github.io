            <div>• Interacted with the representative of <b>Dot Graphics LLP</b> on topics such as paper, print, color, and design.<br></div><div><br></div><div>• Saw <b>Cybernetic's</b> machines in action, including receiving and feeding, as well as packaging automation</div><div><br></div><div>• Asked questions and cleared doubts with <b>Fibre Foils Pvt Ltd</b> about using paper as a packaging material. They use a special type of paper and multiple layers of the same paper to create cylindrical containers of all sizes. I was impressed by the durability and printability of the paper-made containers. These containers can be used for primary, secondary, and tertiary packaging, depending on the product. Some examples of their usage include large drums for storing and transporting wires, selling baked cookies, and storing dry fruits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>• Saw <b>SM Food Engineering'</b>s fully automated machinery in action, producing potato chips.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>• Visited the stall of <b>Totai</b>, a Japan-based company specializing in packaging and printing. As a gift, they offered two ice gel packets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>• <b>Asked questions</b> to a Taiwan-based company about why they seal a larger area of their shampoo packets. The representative explained that it's for safety. They ship the shampoo packets in bulk, and they are stacked on top of each other inside a box. To prevent leakage, they seal a larger area of the plastic.<i>&nbsp;</i></div><div><br></div><div>• Received magazines from Packaging <i>South Asia, IndiFoodBev, and Indian Printer and Publisher<u>.</u></i></div><div><br></div>

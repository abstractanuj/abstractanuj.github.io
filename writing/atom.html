                <p>The Atom is the smallest unit of matter. They are solid but they also have smaller subatomic particles inside them. There is a considerable amount of empty space between these subatomic particles.</p>
        
                <h3>1. Electrons</h3>
                <p><em>Electrons</em> are negatively charged particles that lie in an orbital around the nucleus, in their respective "shells".</p>
                <p><em>Note:</em> Orbit is different from an orbital. An orbit is a pathway defined mathematically. Whereas an orbital is a 3-Dimensional region (let's call it an electron cloud) around the nucleus within which we can find elections 90% of the time. It's more like an abstract probability space than an actual 3D sphere.</p>
                
                <h4>Why don't electrons fall into the nucleus?</h4>
                <p>Since they are negatively charged and protons are positively charged, they must attract each other, and therefore electrons must fall into the nucleus. What's stopping them? This could have been the case if the electrons were <em>orbiting</em> around the nucleus.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electrons move very fast, in random directions inside their electron cloud.</li>
                    <li>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle — You can never know where a particle is and where it's going <em>at the same time.</em> If, hypothetically, the electron were to exist inside the nucleus, it would have to be moving way past the speed of light, which is not possible.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>2. Nucleus</h3>
                <p>The <em>Nucleus</em> is where neutrons and protons lie closely packed together. The neutron acts like a glue, sticking together protons and itself.</p>
                <h4>Why don't protons repel each other inside the nucleus?</h4>
                <p>This is because of the neutron binding them together, as well as the fact that the energy with which protons repel each other is very small compared to electron-electron repulsion. They do try to repel each other all the time but remain together without any success.</p>
        
                <h3>3. Protons & Neutrons</h3>
                <p><em>Protons</em> are positively charged particles. <em>Neutrons</em> are neutral, i.e., they don't have any charge.</p>
        
                <h3>4. Charge</h3>
                <p><em>Charge</em> is apparently just a name given to the effect of an electron, proton and neutron. Talking about charge is useless unless we specify what kind of charge, i.e., positive or negative charge.</p>
                <p>In an atom, protons carry a <em>positive charge</em>. This means they must be repelling each other inside the nucleus. On the other hand, the electrons orbiting in the shells must also be trying to repel each other.</p>
                <p>Protons do not participate when an atom tries to bond with another atom—it's the electrons that actively participate.</p>

            <div><div>0. The Atom is the smallest unit of matter.</div><div>They are solid but they also have smaller subatomic particles inside them.</div><div>There is empty space between these subatomic particles and it is of a considerable amount.</div><div><br></div><div>1.&nbsp;<i>Electrons</i> are negatively charged particles that lie in an orbital around the nucleus, in their respective "shells".<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><i>Note</i>: Orbit is different from an orbital.</div><div>Orbit is a pathway defined mathematically.</div><div>Whereas an orbital is a 3-Dimensional region (let's call it an electron cloud) around the nucleus within which we can find elections 90% of the time. It's more like an abstract probability space than an actual 3D sphere.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Why don't electrons fall into the nucleus?</i></div><div><i>Since they are negatively charged and protons are positively charged they must attract eachother and therefore electrons must fall into the nucleus. What's stopping them?</i></div><div>This could have been the case if the electrons were <i>orbiting</i> around the nucleus.</div><div>a. Electrons move very fast, in random directions inside their electron cloud.</div><div>b. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle — You can never know where a particle is and where it's going <i>at the same time.</i></div><div>Say, if hypothetically the electron must exist inside the nucleus then it must be going way par the speed of light. Which is not possible.</div><div><br></div><div><div>2.&nbsp;<i>Nucleus</i> is a place where neutron and proton lie closely packed together.</div><div>Neutron acts like a glue, sticking together protons and itself.</div><div><i>Why don't protons repel eachother inside the nucleus?</i>&nbsp;b/c of the neutron binding them together, as well as b/c of the fact that the energy with which protons repel eachother is very less as compared to electron-electron repulsion. They do try to repel eachother all the time but without any success remain together.</div><div><br></div><div>3.&nbsp;<i>Protons</i> are positively charged particles.</div><div><br></div><div>4.&nbsp;<i>Neutrons</i> are neutral, i.e. they don't have any charge.</div><div><br></div><div>5.&nbsp;<i>Charge </i>is apparently just a name given to the effect of an electron, proton and neutron. Talking about charge is useless unless we specify&nbsp;what kind of charge<i>. </i>i.e. positive charge and or negative charge.</div><div><br></div><div>In an atom -- protons carry p<i>ostive charge. </i>Meaning they must be repelling eachother inside the nucleus, on the other hand, the electrons orbiting in the shells must also be trying to repel eachother.</div><div><br></div><div>• Protons do not participate when an atom tries to bond with another atom -- it's the electrons that actively participate.</div><div><br></div></div>

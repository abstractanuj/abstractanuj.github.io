                <p>My undergraduate thesis was on the topic of quantum mechanics. I was fascinated by the strange and wonderful world of quantum mechanics, and I wanted to learn more about it. My thesis was a review of the literature on the topic, and I also did some of my own research.</p><p>I found that quantum mechanics is a very complex and challenging subject, but it is also a very rewarding one. I learned a lot about the nature of reality and the universe, and I also learned a lot about myself. I am grateful for the opportunity to have studied quantum mechanics, and I would encourage anyone who is interested in the subject to learn more about it.</p>

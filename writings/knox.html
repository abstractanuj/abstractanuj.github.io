        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Partially unlocked a Samsung A04E's restricted features and fully restricted any data sent to the government.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Device given: 26/02/2024. Pwned: 27/02/2024.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>I did it because I wanted to challenge myself and Samsung's security.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p><strong>Block:</strong> During FRP bypass, blocked Knox Manager, Knox Enrollment, Configuration Service, MDM, and Android System's internet access through a firewall.</p>
        <p><strong>Install:</strong> Smart Dock, Rethink DNS, Adguard Premium.</p>
        <p><strong>Enable:</strong> Samsung Modes and Routines, Gesture Navigation, a different theme.</p>
        
        <h3>What's Not Working</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>USB debugging</li>
            <li>[Update]: Wireless debugging works with developer tiles</li>
            <li>System (Android & Security) updates</li>
            <li>PlayStore</li>
            <li>Home button</li>
            <li>Recents button</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is It Worth It?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. The device's specifications are rather good for its price (and add the fact that it's free). You are also not giving any data to the government that they want so desperately (to control you).</p>

        <h3>Closing</h3>
        <p>Samsung's Knox Manager and MDM is a joke. I already have a better phone than this so I'll give this one to someone.</p>

        <h3>Extra</h3>
        <p>If you ever disabled your stock launcher with ADB and rebooted only to get stuck on a boot logo, then just reboot again, but this time in safe mode. *wink*</p>
